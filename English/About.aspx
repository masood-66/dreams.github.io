                    Dreams are real and the art of dream interpretation is a knowledge given by Allah Almighty. I have been researching on books published in various periods on dreams and their interpretation. While this study blessed me with knowledge, it also fueled the desire in me to share the wealth of knowledge from these books with all my friends; so that it is easy for everyone to know the meaning of their dreams. I have tried that material of all the famous Imams present in different authentic books is made available to the world in original condition. This little effort of mine is in front of you, with the hope that you will surely benefit from it.
